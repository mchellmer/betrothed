      Mark and Josephine met while studying at Amherst College in Winter 2012. They quickly grew inseparable with Mark falling for Josephine's genuine curiosity of life, and Josephine for Mark's storytelling. Their partnership is marked by a mutual love for adventure, technology, the pursuit of knowledge, and laughter. Through the trials and questions presented to a young couple forged in a new millenia, Mark and Josephine will gladly and fiercly greet any challenge life should present.

            Mark grew up in Stockton California where he grew up enjoying nature; the Summer lakesides and winding mountains of the Sierras, the Winter snowtops surrounding Lake Tahoe, the endless sunshine in the valley, and the cool ocean breeze off the rocky cliffs of Monterey. Mark left California shortly after finishing school to write his own story. He joined the Army Rangers and worked in intel where he developed his passion for science. Military life granted Mark his value for stoicism and perserverence, however, the lifestyle of a Ranger was ultimately incompatible with Mark's pursuit of freedom. He left the Army and enrolled in Amherst College where he took a degree in Geology; having completed research in Montana, Massachusetts, Canada, and Ireland. Mark continued his research in environmental contaminants in hydrogeology during his Fulbright Scholarship to Siberia where he worked on fluid flow modelling to treat waste water from open-pit coal mines. To satisfy Mark's interest in environmental engineering he enrolled in Imperial College London to pursue a masters degree in Hydrology. At Imperial Mark acquired funding for and organised field research in Bangladesh where he proposed a new method for operating managed aquifer recharge wells in rural Bangladesh. Mark now works in London where he designs scalable cloud infrastructure, develops his surfing ability, and drinks too much coffee.
